          The Community Farming Initiative (CFI) is a transformative effort by
          Sawyer Camp Farmers CIG to combat food insecurity and empower
          impoverished families. Recognizing that many local families struggle
          to afford three square meals a day, SCFCIG has committed to utilizing
          its reserved lands to support subsistence farming.

          How It Works
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          Sawyer Camp Farmers CIG designates portions of its undeveloped land to
          be cultivated by local families in need. These families are granted
          access to small plots of land where they can grow food crops to
          sustain themselves. This initiative not only provides immediate relief
          from hunger but also fosters self-sufficiency within the community.

          The CFI is not just about land distribution; it is about empowerment.
          Beneficiary families receive guidance from SCFCIG farmers on best

          <li>Crop selection and rotation to maximize yield.</li>

          By equipping families with farming knowledge and resources, the CFI
          ensures that these small-scale farmers can optimize their yield and
          provide for their households throughout the year.

          The Cocoa Coffee Seedling Project (CCSP) is a strategic initiative led
          by Sawyer Camp Farmers CIG (SCFCIG) to address low crop yields and
          environmental degradation in rural communities. Through this program,
          SCFCIG is transforming how small-scale farmers cultivate cocoa and

        <Text>
          SCFCIG farmers cultivate high-quality cocoa and coffee seedlings in
          specialized nurseries using modern techniques. Once the seedlings are
          mature and healthy, they are distributed to local small-scale farmers
          at no cost. These robust seedlings significantly enhance crop success
          rates, enabling farmers to improve productivity and income.

          The CCSP is more than just a seedling supply initiative; itâ€™s a

        </ul>
